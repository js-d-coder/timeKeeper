# timeKeeper
Time Keeper is a simple time management journal. It helps you to pre-plan your daily activities and keep track of your time.  
It will help you to determine:

* Is this the best use of my time?
* Am I doing the right task at the right time?
* Are there any tasks that could be eliminated or put off?
* If you could cut down on the amount of time you're spending on certain tasks?

**In short, it will help you to increase your productivity.**
